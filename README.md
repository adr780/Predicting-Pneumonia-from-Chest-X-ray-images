# Predicting-Pneumonia-from-Chest-X-ray-images
The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to classify whether a patient has pneumonia or not, given images of their chest x-rays.Pneumonia is an inflammatory infection that primarily affects small air sacks in the lungs known as alveoli. In more severe cases, these sacks may fill with fluid. Symptoms include coughing, chest pain, fever, and labored breathing. Each year, ~450 million people are infected globally and about 4 million of those die. The 20th century brought antibiotics and vaccines, which greatly increase survival rates, however pneumonia remains the leading cause of death in developing nations, as well as infants, seniors, and the chronically ill.
The dropout prevented this model from overfitting as much and reduced the loss of the model to 23.7%. The accuracy also rose to 91.2%.
